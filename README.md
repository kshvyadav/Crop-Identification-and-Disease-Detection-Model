# Crop Identification and Disease Detection Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model capable of identifying different types of crops and detecting diseases affecting them. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) and is trained on a dataset of images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can automatically analyze images of crops to:

* **Identify the type of crop** present in the image.
* **Detect the presence of diseases** affecting the identified crop.

This can be valuable for farmers, agricultural researchers, and anyone interested in plant health and automated crop monitoring.

## Crops Supported

This model is currently trained to identify and detect diseases in the following seven crops:

* Apple
* Grape
* Corn
* Potato
* Tomato
* Wheat
* Strawberry

## Repository Contents

* `Crop_Identification_and_Disease_Detection_Model.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete Python code for training, evaluating, and potentially using the crop identification and disease detection model. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Crop-Identification-and-Disease-Detection-Model.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Crop-Identification-and-Disease-Detection-Model.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username)

2.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the `Crop_Identification_and_Disease_Detection_Model.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3.  **Follow the instructions within the notebook:** The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step, including any necessary data preparation, model training, and usage examples.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. These typically include:

* Python (version 3.x recommended)
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
* Image processing libraries like OpenCV or Pillow
* Data manipulation libraries like NumPy and Pandas
* Libraries for data visualization such as Matplotlib and Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python # Example for TensorFlow
# or
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python # Example for PyTorch
