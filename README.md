# Crop Identification and Disease Detection Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model capable of identifying different types of crops and detecting diseases affecting them. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) and is trained on a dataset of images.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can automatically analyze images of crops to:

* **Identify the type of crop** present in the image.
* **Detect the presence of diseases** affecting the identified crop.

This can be valuable for farmers, agricultural researchers, and anyone interested in plant health and automated crop monitoring.

## Crops Supported

This model is currently trained to identify and detect diseases in the following seven crops:


* Corn
* Grape
* Potato
* Tomato

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. These typically include:

* Python (version 3.10 recommended)
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
* Image processing libraries like OpenCV or Pillow
* Data manipulation libraries like NumPy and Pandas
* Libraries for data visualization such as Matplotlib and Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
